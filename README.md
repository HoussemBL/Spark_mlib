# Spark_mlib
Project is based on the example given in:\
https://towardsdatascience.com/a-tutorial-using-spark-for-big-data-an-example-to-predict-customer-churn-9078ac9a1e85



We analyze 19GB from data (taken from link below)\
https://www.kaggle.com/mryanm/luflow-network-intrusion-detection-data-set \
This dataset describes potential situation of malicious cyber intrusion.


The following dataset contains many entries.
Each entry describe possible caractertics of potiontial cyber threat. 
Each entry has also a label haiving one of the possible following values:
1. Malicious
1. Begnin
1. Outlier
 

Our target here is to learn a model capable to predict labels of  entries similar to those available in these files.



Another solution (implemnted in python) for this problem is available in Kaggle plateform (see link below)\
