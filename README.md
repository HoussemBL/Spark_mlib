We analyze 19GB from data (from link below) to be able to detect intrusion
https://www.kaggle.com/mryanm/luflow-network-intrusion-detection-data-set


The following dataset contains many entries.
Each entry describe possible caractertics of potiontial cyber threat. 
Each entry has also a label haiving one of the possible following values:
1. Malicious
1. Begnin
1. Outlier
 

Our target here is to learn a model capable to predict labels of  entries similar to those available in these files.
